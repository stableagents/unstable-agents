## Intro 

Agents are growing in popularity and while they do it's important to have a clear and comprehensive list of what they can and more important currently can't do. This repo exists to stay up to date with the latest advancements and use cases in AI Agents.

## Mutli-Tasking Agents

- [ ] Purchase and then summarize a book from Amazon.com
- [-] Donate to a twitch streamer
- [?] Updating an expired discord link for my webapp, copy and pasting the new link to my codebase on github and redeploy my webapp
- [X] Shop for house and accurately find one baesd on my description
- [X] Create a Spotify Playlist
- [X] Opening Google Docs and drafting that CBER/CDRH jurisdictional clarification letter I’ve been dragging my feet on sending to FDA.
- [-] Reading the fact that there are a bunch of job offers to go out off of my Asana inbox, and opening tabs with the DocuSign offers I need to sign.
- [X] Generating a pull request to fix some bugs or maybe pick off an Asana task in one of the web app projects.
